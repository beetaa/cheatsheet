toolkit-cheatsheet
==================

> Cheatsheet boilerplate. Created for the new [lesscss.org](http://lesscss.org) website (planned for later this year!), based on "[Shopify Cheat Sheet](http://cheat.markdunkley.com/)" by [Mark Dunkley](https://twitter.com/markdunkley).


## Getting Started

A few things you need to know first.

  1. _Cheatsheet_ is contructed using basic templates and Less.js. If you prefer straight HTML, CSS and JavaScript you can grab those from `gh-pages` branch.
  2. It's super-easy to work with the templates, just run `npm install` to install the depencies listed in `package.json`, then run `grunt assemble` to build.
  3.

  * `cheatsheet.less`

Cheatsheet uses [Assemble](http://github.com/assemble/assemble), a Grunt.js plugin that makes it dead simple to build component with templates, external data





## Drop-in for Bootstrap

As with most Toolkit components, _cheatsheet_ is designed as a drop-in component for [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap).

To **work properly**:

  * `bootstrap-collapse.js`

To **look like the example**:
  * `grid.less`
  *
